Intrudersec
Intrudersec is a web application developed using React and Vite. It serves as a foundational template for building modern web applications, incorporating essential tools and configurations to streamline development.

Features
React + Vite Integration: Combines the power of React with Vite's fast build tooling.

Hot Module Replacement (HMR): Enables real-time updates during development without full page reloads.

ESLint Configuration: Includes a basic ESLint setup to maintain code quality and consistency.

Getting Started

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
